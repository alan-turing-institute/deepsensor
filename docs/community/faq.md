## Questions

**Q: What is the purpose of this project?**

**Answer:** [Briefly describe the project, its objectives, and its intended audience.]

**Q: Why doesn't the package name `DeepSensor` mention NPs if it's all about neural processes?**

**Answer:**
We didn't specify NPs in the title because we want DeepSensor to be extensible to potential
future models that are not NPs. We also want to keep the name short and easy to remember.
The name `DeepSensor` is a reference to the fact that the library is about deep learning and sensor data.
