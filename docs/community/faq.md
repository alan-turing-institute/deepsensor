## Questions

**Q: Why doesn't the package name `DeepSensor` mention NPs if it's all about neural processes?**

**Answer:**
DeepSensor aims to be extensible to models that are not necessarily NPs.
We also wanted to keep the name short and easy to remember.
The name `DeepSensor` is a reference to the fact that the library is about deep learning and sensor data.
