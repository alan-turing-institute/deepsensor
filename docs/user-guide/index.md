# User Guide

The DeepSensor user guide will walk you through the core components of the package using
code examples and visualisations.

The pages of this guide are Jupyter notebooks and are fully-reproducible.
Some of the notebooks depend on previous notebooks to be run, e.g.  model training.
However, most of the notebooks can be run in a standalone way without any modification.
Click the download button at the top of the pages to download the .ipynb files
if you would like to run them yourself.
